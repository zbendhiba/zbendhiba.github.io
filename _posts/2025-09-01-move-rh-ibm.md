This is a bittersweet day. Today, I'm officially transitioning from Red Hat to IBM, but it feels less like a departure and more like a reunion. I’m moving to join the rest of my team, my closest colleagues and my extended Middleware team, who made the shift just two months ago. It's a crazy feeling to leave Red Hat for the very people who made my time there so special.

For the past five years, my closest colleagues and my extended Middleware team have been my second family. I'm honored to continue our journey together, working on Open Source, Apache Camel, Quarkus, Camel AI, Java and many projects. Our shared values and mutual trust are the foundation of this incredible team, and I know we’ll continue to do amazing things together.

This has been the most fulfilling chapter of my 17+ year career, and my heart is full of gratitude for the journey. Beyond the projects, the Red Hat community taught me invaluable lessons about leadership, authenticity, and the power of embracing our differences in collaboration. I’ve learned to be my most genuine self. The trust, kindness, positive energy, and innovation of the people I had the honor to work with was contagious and truly lifted me up. I want to express my deepest gratitude to all the incredible people who shaped this experience. I’m sad to close this chapter and say goodbye to so many amazing people. I'll carry these lessons with me for the rest of my career journey and even in my personal life.

Looking forward, I'm excited to discover new paths for innovation and growth in my career. I'm ready to meet new people, embrace fresh challenges, and continue collaborating with my fellow Red Hatters and assisting customers as needed. I'm also deeply committed to remaining present and active in the communities I belong to. The journey ahead is exhilarating!
