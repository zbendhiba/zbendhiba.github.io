I recently gave a talk at [Blabla conf](https://www.blablaconf.com/){:target="_blank"} diving deep into the Staff Engineer role. It's a key position for technical leadership, and in my talk, I cover:

- 🎙️ What Staff Engineer means
- 💥 The challenges I've encountered
- 🔄 My unique path
- 🔥 My open source adventure
- ✨ My Principal Engineer role at Red Hat


I also touched on cultural nuances, particularly from a Moroccan perspective, that can influence this journey.

If you are fluent in Moroccan Darija, it's your call to watch the video.
