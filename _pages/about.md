### Hello there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Zineb Bendhiba, a Principal Software Engineer (ex Red Hat) at IBM. My work is defined by a clear mission: creating useful and impactful solutions for users.

I'm a strong believer in the power of open source. I actively contribute to the solutions of tomorrow by innovating and collaborating with the community. My passion for learning drives me to build libraries and tools that can keep up with constant technological evolution.

I'm a committer and PMC member for the Apache Camel project. My leadership has a wide-scale impact. I serve as a main maintainer for Camel Quarkus and contribute to Camel AI. I'm also proud to have helped shape the ideas for new projects like Wanaku and Kaoto.

Beyond the code, I am deeply involved in the developer and Java communities. I love sharing knowledge by speaking at conferences like Devoxx and Red Hat Summit. I also write articles and am a guest on tech podcasts. I'm proud to be an alumna of the Duchess France community.

When I'm not with my family or exploring new places, you can find me pursuing my two passions of building open-source projects and dancing, or investing time in my personal development.
