### Hello there 👋
Hi, I’m Zineb Bendhiba, I'm Principal Software Engineer at Red Hat, where I contribute to the Apache Camel project. As we shape the future of integration within the open source community, I work with others across the developer community to drive progress, adoption, and innovation. I'm passionate about making open source integration more accessible, user-friendly, and greater for all.
