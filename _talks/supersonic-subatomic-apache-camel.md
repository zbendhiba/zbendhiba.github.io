In this talk, we will discover how the joy of developing with Quarkus can be applied to Apache Camel. We will see how easy it is to develop and deploy supersonic integration connectors with Java that startup in just a few milliseconds.

Apache Camel is an integration framework and the most active project of the Apache Software Foundation. With more than 350 different connectors, it is the best tool to create decoupled and easy to maintain software architectures.

The Camel Quarkus project, is the Apache Camelâ€™s subproject that brings the integration capabilities of Apache Camel, and its components into the Quarkus ecosystem.
