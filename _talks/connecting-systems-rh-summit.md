#### Abstract

Have you ever struggled with connecting systems in a cloud-native environment? This is a common challenge for many microservices architectures. To address this challenge, weâ€™ll introduce the Red Hat build of Apache Camel and Red Hat AMQ. In this talk, weâ€™ll explore tools and approaches to help you break down silos and seamlessly integrate your microservices with external systems, allowing for faster development cycles and more efficient integration.

Red Hatâ€™s build of Apache Camel is a powerful tool designed to streamline the integration process in different environments, including Red Hat Openshift. With its rich set of routing, filtering, and transformation capabilities, Camel is a versatile system integration tool that can help you integrate your cloud-native microservices. AMQ is a flexible messaging platform that delivers information reliably, enabling real-time integration and connecting the Internet of Things.

We will also dive into developing cloud-native applications that can seamlessly connect various systems using the Red Hat build of Apache Camel and Red Hat AMQ. With just a few lines of code, witness the smooth integration between various systems and discover how these technologies fit together, run smoothly, and deploy on Openshift.

By the end of this talk, youâ€™ll have the tools and knowledge to connect your microservices with external systems faster and more efficiently.
