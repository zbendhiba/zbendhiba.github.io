#### Talk with [Otavio Piske](https://twitter.com/otavio021){:target="_blank"}

In an ever-accelerating IT world, the need to connect different software systems is growing day by day. More than ever, we need to have a tool to easily create decoupled and easy integration connectors between several external systems. But more importantly, we need to be able to scale those into the Cloud.

Apache Camel with its 350 connectors gives a proven response to such a demand. In this talk, we will present Apache Camel and explain how to scale Apache Camel based microservices to the cloud. We will present how to make your Camel, Camel Quarkus and Camel K solutions to make them more scalable, high-performing, and observable.
