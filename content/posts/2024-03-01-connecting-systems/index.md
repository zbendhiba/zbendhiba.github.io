Have you ever struggled with connecting systems that were not designed to communicate with each other? This is a common challenge faced by many microservices architectures today.

In the last quarter, I gave a talk where I explored some of the tools and approaches that can help you break down these silos and integrate your microservices with external systems seamlessly, allowing for faster development cycles and more efficient integration.

The talk combines my current experience as a thought leader in the integration space, working on the Apache Camel project, and my past experiences where I encountered many integration challenges developing Microservices.

The recording from the DevNation Day: Modern App Dev is already available.
