Thrilled to announce my graduation from the Red Hat Engineering Leadership Accelerator program last week! It was an extraordinary opportunity to visit the Boston office and connect with our top executives and fellow cohort leaders.

I feel incredibly honored and grateful to have been a part of the dynamic 2024 cohort. Over the past nine months, I've gained invaluable insights from various leaders across different organizations.

Alongside my strategy team, it was a privilege to work on strategic initiatives and pitch our ideas to top executives. This experience has been truly enriching and a highlight of my leadership journey.

### Official Recognition
