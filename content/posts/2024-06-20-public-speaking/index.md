For the past 3 years, I've been speaking at tech conferences, something I had dreamed of doing for a long time. I love technology and going to tech events. I learn a lot from the experts who share their big ideas and projects. 🌟

Speaking in public can be scary, though. I used to have a routine that helped calm my nerves before my talks. But now, I don't need it anymore. Why? I've found a way to connect with the audience that I truly enjoy. ❤️

Connecting with my audience is what keeps me going as a speaker. 🎤

Now that I have more experience, I want to share 3 tips for new speakers:

1. Trust Your Audience 
Being scared is normal, but think about why you go to conferences. Feel the good vibes from your audience. Stop worrying about them judging you. You are on the stage because you deserve to be there and you have interesting things to say. Share your knowledge and stories with confidence. 👥

2. Look at Your Audience
Make sure you look at your audience, not the floor or just your slides. If you are doing something like live coding, remember to look up at your audience from time to time. If you are speaking online, you can't see your audience but imagine they are right in front of you. Look at the camera and try to feel the connection. Speak naturally and keep your speech clear and simple. 📹👀

3. Share with Passion
Love what you talk about. Your passion will connect you to your audience and make your speech powerful. If you forget what to say, let your passion guide you back. 🔥

Always use your unique voice, whether it's a small meeting or a big conference. 🗣️

If you want to start speaking, why not submit your talk to Devoxx Morocco ? We are accepting proposals until July 7th. 📅
