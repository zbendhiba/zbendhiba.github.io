3 mistakes that are preventing you from overcoming integration challenges:

1. Too Much Protocol Focus
You spend excessive time coding access to various protocols rather than utilizing existing solutions, focusing more on implementation than on quickly delivering business value.

2. Lack of Flexibility
Your integration design isn't adaptable, making it difficult to introduce updates or new steps efficiently.

3. Poor Monitoring of Data Flows
Without a clear integration strategy, overseeing and managing the data flows within your system becomes complicated, making it tough to adapt to system evolutions.

That’s why [Apache Camel](https://camel.apache.org/) exists. It's a swiss-knife open source integration project that offers:

1. Business Logic Focus
Implements a wide array of Enterprise Integration Patterns, with a rich component set for connecting nearly anything. Its DSL enables seamless and quick integration, letting you concentrate on business logic.

2. Flexibility
Its DSL provides high flexibility in integration writing, allowing easy component or step modifications across various runtimes and environments.

3. Enhanced Monitoring and Management
Comes equipped with robust tools for monitoring and managing data flows, plus diagnostics for production issues.
