Last week, I had the privilege of co-presenting a tech talk alongside [Erin Schnabel](https://www.linkedin.com/in/erinschnabel/). Together, we delved into the world of Microservices Integration Patterns.

In this session, we leveraged Apache Camel to explore integration patterns that add flexibility and resilience to your evolving architecture.

The recording is already available.
