Do you think hobbies don't matter much for your career? 🤔 I used to think so, but dancing has taught me key skills that have really helped boost my career. 💃

Before dancing:
 - I was too hard on myself and overly critical, which sapped my confidence and affected my interactions with others. 😓
 - I hesitated to take initiatives when outcomes were unclear. 🚧
 - I couldn’t give presentations because I was afraid of not being perfect. 🎤➡️😱

The transformation through dancing: 
Getting on stage, facing the audience, and dealing with the pressure of the moment helped me accept my body and my skills as they are. Learning to be okay with where I am was key to getting over my fears and uncertainties. Additionally, performing in a team taught me the importance of understanding and supporting others' strengths, which has been crucial in contributing to our collective success. 🌟

After dancing:
 - Embracing my authentic self has led to smoother and more effective decision-making, empowering me to act decisively and creatively in uncertain situations. 🌊
 - My ability to understand and value other people’s strengths has been significantly enhanced, leading to even better teamwork and more effective collaborative problem-solving. 👥
 - My confidence has grown significantly, allowing me to speak in public and lead presentations confidently. 📢

Dancing has changed the way I approach my work, showing me that following your passion can unlock new skills and improve your professional life. 🚀
