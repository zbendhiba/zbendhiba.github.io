Last week, I had the pleasure to present a talk about MCP usage to connect AI to our Entreprise Systems. I gave my thoughts on why we got to MCP, and presented the opportunity that led to creating the wanaku project.

During the talk, I introduced how to create an MCP server with Quarkus, and how to integrate it with LangChain4j. I also demoed the wanaku project, many of its capabilities, and how it fits in a Quarkus AI infused application.

It was also wonderful to reconnect with the community, attend other inspiring talks, and have great conversations with many developers and tech leaders. These moments of connection and knowledge sharing are what make conferences like Devoxx so special.
