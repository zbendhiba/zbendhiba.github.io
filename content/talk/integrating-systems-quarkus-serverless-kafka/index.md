#### Abstract and talk prepared with [Peter Palaga](https://twitter.com/ppalaga)

Have you ever got the task to implement an exchange of data between two systems that were not designed to communicate with each other? We bet you have, and we dare to introduce a couple of tools and approaches making the task easier to accomplish.

First, we'll speak about Apache Camel, the Swiss knife of integrating heterogeneous systems. It offers 300+ connectors out of the box, to transfer data to and from a wide variety of systems.

Second, we will show what fun it is to write Camel integrations on top of Quarkus. You'll learn about the famous Quarkus dev mode and dev services.

Third, we will explain how the outstanding integration capabilities of Apache Camel enrich serverless architectures based on Knative.
