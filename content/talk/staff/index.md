# 🇲🇦 Leading Beyond Code - My Journey as a Staff Engineer

Hi, I'm Zineb. As a Moroccan developer who fell into open source, I've learned a lot about myself and my leadership skills. From coding in Java to becoming a Staff Engineer at a global leader in the open source community, it's been a journey of ups and downs.

In this talk, I'll share my story: how I found my way, what I learned along the way, and what I wish I had known when I started out on this journey.
