# 🇬🇧  MCP in Action: Connecting AI to Enterprise Systems

#### Abstract

Artificial intelligence is evolving rapidly, but one challenge remains: efficiently connecting AI agents to the systems where data resides. Each new data source requires a specific integration, limiting the scalability and relevance of models.

[The Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/mcp) addresses this issue by defining an open standard to link AI assistants to enterprise systems: from databases to business tools and development environments.

In this talk, I will introduce MCP through [Wanaku](https://wanaku.ai/), an open-source MCP server based on [Quarkus](https://quarkus.io/) and [Apache Camel](https://camel.apache.org/), developed by our team to simplify these integrations. I will share our experience building it, the challenges we faced, and the lessons we learned. You'll also see how MCP, combined with modern Java technologies, enables seamless and secure connections between AI and enterprise data.

Join me to explore how this protocol is paving the way for more connected and intelligent AI systems!
