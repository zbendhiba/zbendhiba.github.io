    <h3>Hello there 👋</h3>
    <p>I'm Zineb Bendhiba. I love building things that solve real problems for users. Currently, I'm a Principal Software Engineer (ex Red Hat) at IBM, working at the intersection of AI and Enterprise Integration.</p>
    <p>I'm a big believer in open source and collaboration. I'm a PMC member for Apache Camel and a maintainer for Camel Quarkus, with a deep focus on the Quarkus ecosystem. Most of my work is dedicated to these core projects, but I also focus on bringing new innovation into the ecosystem. I enjoy exploring new concepts and helping kick-start initiatives that move our community forward. This is how I've helped shape the early visions for projects like Wanaku, Kaoto, and Camel AI.</p>

I don't just stay behind my screen. I love being part of the open source and developer communities. You'll often find me on stage at conferences like Devoxx or Red Hat Summit sharing my insights. I also help shape these events as a member of the CFP committee for Devoxx France and Devoxx Morocco. I'm a proud alumna of Duchess France, which is a community that means a lot to me.

When I'm not building new libraries, features or experimenting with new tech, you can find me with my family, traveling, or dancing. I'm always looking for ways to keep learning and growing, both as a developer and as a person.
