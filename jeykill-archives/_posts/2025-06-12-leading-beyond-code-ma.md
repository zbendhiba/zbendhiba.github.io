I recently gave a talk at [Blabla conf](https://www.blablaconf.com/){:target="_blank"} diving deep into the **Staff Engineer**  role. It's a key position for technical leadership, and in my talk, I cover:

- 🎙️ What a **Staff Engineer**  means
- 💥 The challenges I've encountered
- 🔄 My unique path
- 🔥 My open source adventure
- ✨ My **Principal Software Engineer** role at **Red Hat**


I also touched on **cultural nuances**, particularly from a **Moroccan perspective**, that can influence this journey.

If you are fluent in Moroccan Darija, **you can watch the video here** .
